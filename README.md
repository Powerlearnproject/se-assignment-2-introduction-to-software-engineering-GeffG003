# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the systematic application of engineering principles and methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering involves use of advance tools for method control and structured methodologies such as agile and waterfall while traditional programming is less formal and is often used in small scale.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
PHASES
Requirements:Involves collection of user demands and system specifications
Design:Developing detailed plans of the software structure and interphase
Implementation;Constructing the software based on the plans decided
Testing:Perfoming various evaluations to ensure the software functions well
Deployment:Distributing the software to users
Maintainance:Offering support to clients,updates and improvements to software system after its release

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
AGILE VS WATERFALL:
Agile approach puts emphasis on flexibilty and adaptable change while waterfall is based on sequence approach thus is rarely adaptable to change when the project starts
AGILE AND WATERFALL
Waterfall is sequential while agile follows a continous cycle 
Waterfall is rigid while agile is flexible
Waterfall a project is planned upfront while agile a continous apporach is followed with each stage being decided as we continue
Waterfall is good for clearly defined requirments and large scale projects 
Agile is good for evolving and small scale projects
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING
Is a systematic process of documenting validating and managing eeds nad specifications of a software systems' stakeholders
IMPORTANCE
It ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the system requirements.
Ensures a better project planning and management of a software system.
It ensures all requirements are met.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
CONCEPT OF MODULARITY
Modularity involves dividing a software into independent units with specific functionalty
HOW IT IMPROVES MAINTAINABILITY AND SCALABILITY
The developers are able to focus on one part at a time providing near perfect results
When a module needs to be updated the changes can be made separately
Its easier to notice when there is a problem with a particular module
The work to be done is distributed efficiently.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
LEVELS OF SOFTWARE TESTING
Unit testing:It focuses on testing individual components and its typically perfomed during the development phase.Helps to identify bugs and errors in dvelopment phase.
Integration testing:It tests the ineraction between different units and modules to ensure individual units work together correctly.
System testing:It focuses on testing the whole system to verify that the software meets the requirements needed
Acceptance testing:It involves validating the software with the user requirments and expectations.
WHY ITS CRUCIAL
It ensures quality
Helps identify defects,bugs and errors in the software
Improves customer satisfaction
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems(VCS)are software tools that track changes to files and manage different versions of those files overtime.
IMPORTANCE
They record every change made to the files
VCS enables different developers to work on the same project simulatenousely.
VCS serves as a backup mechanism
POPULAR VCS
Git:Lightweight and fast and supports branching and merging efficiently
Subversion(SVN):Centralized version system,Tracks changes to files and directories
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
It is to oversee the planning execution and delivery of software projects
RESPONSIBILITIES
project planning
resource management
Risk management
Communicating with stakeholders
Project monitoring and control
CHALLENGES
Communication being poor among project stakeholders leading to misunderstandings
Identifying risks effectively requires proactive planning and foresight which may impact project timelines uf the risk is unforeseen
Managing client expectations can at times be challenging




Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintainance is the process of modifying updating and managing softwares after its been deployed
TYPES OF MAINTAINANCE ACTIVITIES
Corrective maintainance:Fixing defects and bugs
Adaptive maintainance:Making changes to software for it to adapt to new environment
Perfective maintainance:Enhancing or improving software to improve its performance
Preventive mechanism:Proactively identifying and addressing potential issues before they impact the software performance

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Privacy concerns from users whose data has been taken
Bias and discriminations must be avoided in the algoriths
Cybersecurity,Its crucial to protect user data and prevent cyber attacks
HOW
They should stay informed on the various changes in life and community
They should follow ethical guidelines provided
Speak up on concerns about ethical essures

Research done using google,ChatGPT,LEO(Brave browser AI) and lecture notes provided by PLP guide
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
